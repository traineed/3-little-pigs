Based on the video of "The Three Little Pigs," here are suggested learning outcomes tailored for children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities), specifically aligned with the UK EYFS (Early Years Foundation Stage) framework.
Since these learners often benefit from sensory, repetitive, and concrete experiences, the outcomes are broken down by EYFS areas of learning:
## 1. Communication and Language
Outcome: To join in with predictable phrases and sounds from the story.
Focus: Encourage the child to mimic the "Huff and puff" [01:34] or the "Bang" of the door closing [00:30].
SEND/ASD Support: Use PECS symbols or Makaton signs for "pig," "wolf," and "house" to support non-verbal communication.
## 2. Personal, Social and Emotional Development (PSED)
Outcome: To identify and name basic emotions (Scared vs. Happy) shown by the characters.
Focus: Discuss how the pigs felt when they saw the wolf [01:05] compared to how they felt at the end when they were safe and "playing freely" [04:09].
SEND/ASD Support: Use an "Emotion Fan" or "Zones of Regulation" visual to help the child point to how the pig feels when the wolf is at the door.
## 3. Physical Development (Sensory Exploration)
Outcome: To explore and describe the textures of different materials (Straw, Wood, Brick).
Focus: Replicate the building process [00:09]. Provide a sensory bin with real straw, sticks, and small bricks (or Lego).
SEND/ASD Support: This is excellent for sensory seekers or avoiders. Allow them to feel the "scratchy" straw vs. the "hard/smooth" brick to build vocabulary through touch.
## 4. Understanding the World
Outcome: To investigate which materials are "strong" and which can be blown over.
Focus: Using the video's theme of "solid" houses [02:51], have the child try to blow down a straw tower vs. a brick tower using their own breath or a small fan.
SEND/ASD Support: This provides a concrete "Cause and Effect" lesson, which is highly effective for ASD learners who benefit from visual and physical evidence.
## 5. Expressive Arts and Design
Outcome: To use prop-based play to re-enact a key part of the story.
Focus: Using small world figures to act out the wolf going down the chimney [03:08].
SEND/ASD Support: For children who find imaginative play difficult, use the video as a literal guide (First, the wolf is on the roof... then he goes down).
Summary Table for Lesson Planning

EYFS Area
Proposed Learning Outcome
Activity Idea
Communication
Join in with "Huff and Puff"
Use a "Big Bad Wolf" puppet to prompt vocalization.
Maths
Count the 3 pigs
Match the 3 pigs to their 3 specific houses [00:00].
PSED
Recognise being "Safe"
Create a "Safe House" (den) in the classroom.


Tip for ASD Learners: Use a Visual Timetable for the session (e.g., 1. Watch video, 2. Feel straw/bricks, 3. Build house, 4. Finished) to reduce anxiety during the transition between activities.
